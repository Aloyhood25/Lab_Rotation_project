m1<-lmer(mean_motility_3frames~time.factor+treatment_combination+
           (1|flyID)+time.factor:treatment_combination,
         data=my_data)

I discovered from the summary of this mixed-effecet model that only 3 out of the 4 time.factor and 3 out of the 4 treatment_combination was reported.
is this expected or is it a possible error?
